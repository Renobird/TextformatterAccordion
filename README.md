# Textformatter Accordion 1.1.1

This Textformatter module for ProcessWire allows you to designate areas in a single textarea to be converted to an collapsed accordion list. The markup pattern for this module is based on the **[TextformatterPagination](https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/TextformatterPagination)** module with the idea that they could be interchangeable.

**[Simple Demo (Front end)](http://jsfiddle.net/hEF6z/3/)**

## How to install 

In ProcessWire 2.4+ go to your Modules menu in the admin, click the "New" tab and 
type or paste in "TextformatterAccordion" and click "Install". 

If you are unable to install using that method, you can also just install the old way 
by copying the files for this module into /site/modules/TextformatterPagination/ and 
clicking "check for new modules" from your Modules screen. 

## How to use

1. In the ProcessWire admin to Setup > Fields and edit the Textarea field that you want to
support accordions. On the "Details" tab, select "Accordion" as a Textformatter and save.

2. include the the CSS/JS (requires jQuery) in your HTML. You can use any css you want to style the accordion list â€” the css included with this module is a barebones example to get you started.

``` html
/path/to/jquery.js
/path/to/TextformatterAccordion.js
/path/to/tTextformatterAccordion.css
```

3. Edit a page that uses the field you added the "Accordion" TextFormatter to in step one.
The textarea now supports content as usual, but can also have multiple collapsed (Accordion) areas.
See the examples below for how to desinate accordion items.

#### To define an accordion item
Put 5+ hyphens '-----Your Title Here' on a single line (within paragraph tags) to specify a title for the accordion item. The paragraphs below will be collapsed.

#### To end an accordion
To end a group of accordion items and return to regular textarea content, put exactly 5 slashes on a single line '/////' (within paragraph tags).
This is only needed if you want to end collapsed content and return to regular textarea content.

#### Markup Example

> ----- Accordion Item
> 
> The paragraphs beneath each accordion item are collapsed by default and open when you click on the title specified above. You can use multiple paragraphs, and any other content allowed in the textarea. 
>
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Donec odio. Quisque volutpat mattis eros. Nullam malesuada erat ut turpis. Suspendisse urna nibh, viverra non, semper suscipit, posuere a, pede.
> 
> ----- Another Accordion Item
> 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Donec odio. Quisque volutpat mattis eros. Nullam malesuada erat ut turpis. Suspendisse urna nibh, viverra non, semper suscipit, posuere a, pede.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Donec odio. Quisque volutpat mattis eros. Nullam malesuada erat ut turpis. Suspendisse urna nibh, viverra non, semper suscipit, posuere a, pede.
>
> /////
>
> The 5 slashes above signify an end to the accordion group above. You only need to specify the end of a group if you want to return to regular textarea content. You can continue to use the same pattern to collapse content into accordions as many times as you wish.
